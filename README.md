# vue-rollup-boilerplate

> A simple rollup + vue-loader setup for quick prototyping.

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init dangvanthanh/vue-rollup-boilerplate my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## What's Included

- `npm run dev`: Rollup + `vue-loader` with hot-reload
- `npm run build`: Production build with CSS/JS minification

For more information see the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Customizations

You will likely need to do some tuning to suit your own needs:

- Install additional libraries that you need such as vue-router, vue-resource, vuex, etc...
- A little development server with live reload capability with [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).

## Fork It And Make Your Own

You can folk this repo to create own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`

vue init username/repo my-project
```
